# Angular Weather App

### Developed a web application in Angular that shows the weather in the specified city.


  API - https://openweathermap.org/api
  
  1. The page should contain a form with an insert, where the user enters the name of the city. After submitting the form, a list with the weather of this city for the next 5 days is shown
  
  2. Shows an error when the specified city was not found
  
  3. Page, list and list item are implemented using components

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. And then run `npm start` to open the application in the browser. 


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
